# Codecraft Programming Challenge

Welcome to *Codecraft, a programming challenge organized by **Encypherist! In this event, you are required to solve any **four out of five* problems to test your coding skills. Challenge yourself, improve your problem-solving abilities, and have fun coding!



## Problem List

1. *Q1: Reverse a Stack*  
   Description: You are given a stack of integers. Your task is to reverse the order of the elements in the stack using only stack operations (push and pop) without using any additional data structures.  
   *Example*:  
   Input: stack = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
   Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

2. *Q2: Three Sum Problem*  
   Description: Given an array of integers, find all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero. The solution should return the list of unique triplets.  
   *Example*:  
   Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]  
   Output: [[-1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 2]]

3. *Q3: Depth-First Search (DFS)*  
   Description: Implement Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse a graph starting from a given vertex. The graph is represented by an adjacency list.

4. *Q4: Implement a Responsive Social Media Platform*  
   Description: Implement a responsive social media platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ensure that the UI displays properly on both desktop and mobile devices, with features like swipe gestures for navigation on touch-enabled devices.
